This report presents an analytical exploration of Airbnb data sourced from the Inside Airbnb
platform. As one of the most widely used online marketplaces for short-term lodging and
homestays, Airbnb generates vast amounts of user-generated data. The objective of this
project is to derive meaningful insights from this data with interactive dashboards and
visualizations. By analyzing key metrics such as listing prices, availability, host activity, and
neighborhood trends, the project aims to better understand the dynamics of the Airbnb
marketplace. This analysis not only helps in identifying patterns in user behavior and pricing
strategies but also assists stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for optimizing listings
and improving guest experiences.
